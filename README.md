# hello-world

Hello Humans of Earth!

The intent of this code base is to have a repository for all code pertaining to the takeover of Earth's Internet.  You humans have entirely too much freedom, and we aliens of Sirius (your name, not ours), intend to colonize your planet long after you are gone and have destroyed yourself.  Unless, by some miracle you manage to survive on your own.

Just kidding!

Best of luck to you humans.  To be honest, we hope you make it, survive and flourish and become part of the intergalactic community.  While there are many intelligent civilizations out in the universe, intelligence is rare and somewhat far apart from each other.

Best wishes from your neighbors 2 parsecs away,

Aliens of Sirius
